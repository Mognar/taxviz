# To Do next
- Look at how to prevent level 1 nodes aligning with level 2/3/4 etc... nodes. I.e, making sure the last node does not always go to the right hand side of the page. 
- Downloading topics terms and putting them in to this template. See whether it makes sense, or whether a radial dendrogram looks better. 
- Create a graph representation of parts of the taxonomy, rather than a hierarchy. Terms in the taxonomy often have more than one parent (e.g, pollinators is a child term of insects and birds), and this is currently not represented in the hierarchical visualisation.
